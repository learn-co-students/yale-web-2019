## Learning Goals
* Explain what an event is in JavaScript
  * Show MDN event list
* Explain what a callback is in JavaScript
* Describe how to "listen" for events on HTML elements

* Identify different events that exist (ex. `DOMContentLoaded`, `click`, `submit`, `scroll`, `keypress`)
* Connect a function to a specific HTML element's event
* Describe event propagation (bubbling)
* Use event delegation to listen to any child HTML element's events
  * Open an event object and see what you can filter by
